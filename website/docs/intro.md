# h6s means headless

- Headless UI Library.

## What are headless components?

> A component that doesnâ€™t have a UI, but has the functionality.

These hooks do not render any markup or styles for you. `h6s` opens up the possibility for your tables to integrate into any existing theme.
If you want to know more about headless components, please refer to this [link](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-complete-guide-to-building-headless-interface-components-in-react).

## Why h6s?

### 1. Integrate Anything

You don't need to extend or customize styles. You don't care what CSS library or Design system framework you're using. Because you don't have to worry about it because you can just integrate it and use it!

### 2. Simplify Complexity

No matter how complex the user interface is, it can be easily implemented with a simplified interface. You don't care about complex internal implementations, just use declarative interfaces

### 3. Lightweight Code

You can use only the package you need for each UI from h6s. Of course, you don't need to worry about bundle size because unused code is tree shaked.
